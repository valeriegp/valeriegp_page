        <p>Valerie Guinn Polgar is a military brat born in El Paso, Texas 
        who has a very difficult time answering the question "where are you from".  
        She attended 5 elementary schools, 1 middle school, and 2 high schools.  Valerie 
        spent every summer (and some winters) visiting family in Chihuahua, Mexico, until
        she went to college in the early 2000s.</p>

        <p>Valerie has a BFA in Digital Art from George Mason University, an MFA in 
        Computer Art from the School of Visual Arts, and is currently pursuing an MS in 
        Computer Science at Tufts University.  She did video editing and motion graphics 
        in NYC in the early 2010s before turning her attention to practicing and teaching 
        art.  She served as a professor/instructor in several universities/colleges in both 
        art and computer science departments in New Jersey, Virginia, and Mississippi until 
        2020.   
        </p>

        <p>Valerie has been the head programmer of experimental film and animation for the
        Oxford Film Festival (OxFilm) since 2017.  She also founded and ran a media
        arts entity called Misbits NMA from 2016 - 2020, which promoted art and technology
        through collaboration in Oxford, MS.  Her current interests involve analyzing the role 
        of contemporary digital/new media artists against the role that emerging tools can play 
        in both shaping and eliminating these identities.  She currently resides in Brookline, 
        MA with her partner and two kids.</p>
